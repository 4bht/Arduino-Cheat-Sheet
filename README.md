Arduino Cheat Sheet
===================

This is a poster-sized cheat sheet for Arduino programmers.  It draws primarily from the [Arduino Language Reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage), including most of the common, basic syntax and a variety of the built-in functions.

It is based on a [cheat sheet by Gavin Smith](http://sites.google.com/site/mechatronicsguy/arduinocheatsheet) and an [SVG adaptation by Frederic Dufourg](http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,7012.msg56273.html#msg56273).  Additionally, the Arduino Uno board drawing is adapted from an Arduino board drawing in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/).

Please let me know if you find any errors -- Thanks!
