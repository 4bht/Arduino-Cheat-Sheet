Arduino Cheat Sheet
===================

This is a poster-sized cheat sheet for Arduino programmers.  It draws primarily from the [Arduino Language Reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage), including most of the common, basic syntax and a variety of the built-in functions.

This is a fork of [liffiton/Arduino-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/liffiton/Arduino-Cheat-Sheet/), which 
is in turn based on a [cheat sheet by Gavin Smith](http://sites.google.com/site/mechatronicsguy/arduinocheatsheet) and an [SVG adaptation by Frederic Dufourg](http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,7012.msg56273.html#msg56273).

This fork contains the ESP32Dev Board PINMAP (instead of an Arduino UNO drawing) as taken from [espressif/arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), i.e. <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/1.0.4/docs/esp32_pinmap.png>. Furthermore from this project 'Arduino core for the ESP32' some specific information is added,
but this is *work in progress*.
